The program contains the class Checker. It has one method.
The method of this class performs a number of the following functions:
1. Checks whether the length of the string is equal to STR_CONST. If not, it terminates the program and writes a log.
2. Checks whether the string begins with docnum or contract character set. If not, it terminates the program and writes a log.
3. Checks suitable files to see if their names contain service characters. If contained, the program ends with a corresponding entry in the log.
4. Suitable files with the docnum are written to the "document" file, with the name contract - to the file "contract"
